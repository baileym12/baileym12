<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/baileym12"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am an Honors Computer Science student at Clemson University with a 4.0 GPA specializing in Software Development and Cybersecurity.

## Objective

I'm passionate about building secure systems and developing defensive strategies against modern cyber threats. I'm particularly interested in opportunities where I can apply my technical skills to create secure, efficient systems while working with others in a collaborative environment.
